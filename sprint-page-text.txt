Sprints are high energy, immersive problem-solving experiences designed to get the very best out of your people. Your employees collaborate to createsolutions that address real-world problems and opportunities in your business. They foster empathy, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration and communication skills in a fun, safe space.

Sprint Preparation is a key to success. Fergal advises on themes / domains that your teams will tackle and the How Might We (HMW) framing that works best. We help you make decisions on Sprint duration (from a half-day to say 20 or 30 hours in total over several weeks), Sprint format (in-person, remote, blended), team formation, Sprint venue and the composition of your judging panel.
